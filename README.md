# DiscordBot

This is a group project I created in the first year of the IMS. I was really fascinated with Bots, especially the ones used in Discord. Because our current programming language topic was C# we tried to do it in that language, which wasn't optimal in any way, because bots are usually written in Python but we somehow managed to make a working bot. We used the DSharpPlus, which is a library for making Discord Bots using the Discord API.

# How does our DiscordBot work?

We have implemented some small commands, they aren't anything special but it's atleast something taken in the case that we were pretty new to this.
Here's the list of our commands:
*bruder
*help
*hi
*memo
*ping
*random
*sum
